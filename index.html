						This project was part of a coding challenge I was given for an

					<p>
						Kickflipsandkickstands.com is a website that I made for a podcast

					</a>
					<p>
						Apollobaymusic.com is a memorial site that I made for a band that I
						used to be in. Were we the best band ever? That's not for me to say.
						But the answer is, yes, yes we were. This site features a music and
						video player and was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
						Bootstrap.

					</a>
					<p>
						The goal with this one was to make a tool for myself that I would

					<p>
						A weather app!? Bet you've never heard of one of those before, have

						This pricing component interface was part of a challenge on

						This tiny project was also a part of a frontendmentor.io challenge.

						BlocJams is a music player that I made as part of my education at

				<p>
					<span>Hello!</span> Thanks for visiting my website! As I’m sure you
					are aware, considering you’re on a website called graysonconnor.com,
					my name is Grayson Connor. I am 25 years old and I got into web
					development about 3 years ago. My journey in web development started
					when I joined a development bootcamp called Bloc.io. At Bloc, I
					learned the fundamentals of web development and about how deep the
					world of web dev goes. Soon after my time at Bloc, I was fortunate
					enough to land a job working at one the biggest tech companies around
					(not trying to name drop but it rhymes with shmUber). My time at this
					aforementioned tech giant was actually incredible. I was able to have
					a hands on role in many areas of the company (P.R., logistics, data
					analytics, etc.) and I got to see what goes into making a big machine
					like that function. Alas, after almost 2 years at Uber (ok there, I
					said it) 2020 happened. Like many others, COVID-19 claimed my job and
					I suddenly had an abundance of free time.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					That’s when I said to myself, “I should get back into coding!” You
					see, at Uber, we used some basic coding as a problem solving tool but,
					it was certainly not the main aspect of my role. So “getting back into
					coding” was really more like, “let’s start coding from scratch again.”
					That’s when stuff got real. I dove head first into teaching (and
					reteaching) myself everything I could about web development and coding
					in general.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					That’s where I’m at now. I’m trying to learn and build as much as I
					can and I’m loving every minute of it. I’m looking forward to building
					more complex projects but, more importantly, projects that are truly
					useful in someones everyday life and work. I’ll keep this site updated
					with projects that I’ve completed and with projects I’m currently
					working on. If you’re interested in my skills or just want to chat,
					don’t hesitate to shoot me an email. Thanks for checking me out!
				</p>
